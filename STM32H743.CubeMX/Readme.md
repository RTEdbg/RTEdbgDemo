## STM32H743.CubeMX Project

This project was created with the STM32CubeMX code generator and was used to create the **Simple_STM32H743** and **STM32H743** demo projects. The project has been stripped of all unnecessary HAL driver and header files for clarity.

Use a tool like WinMerge to compare this project with the other two. This will allow you to see how the data logging functions have been integrated into the project. In addition, some modifications have been made to integrate data logging into the exception handler.
