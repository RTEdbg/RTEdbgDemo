# RTEdbg Demo Code

Demo projects have been created to demonstrate the use of the RTEdbg function library - see the **[List of all demo projects](https://github.com/RTEdbg/RTEdbg?tab=readme-ov-file#Demo-Projects)**.

Most of the code has been developed and tested using the STM32CubeIDE (GNU C toolchain). Several projects also include IDE settings and startup files for Keil MDK and IAR EWARM. Support for the popular J-Link and ST-LINK debug probes has also been implemented. The *Simple_STM32H743* demo *"TEST RTEgetData"* folder contains sample batch and configuration files for demonstrating the RTEgetData data transfer utility - see also *[RTEgetData repository](https://github.com/RTEdbg/RTEgetData)*.

The document **[Fault_handler.md](./STM32H743/RTEdbg/Demo_code/Fault_handler.md)** contains links to Cortex-M4/M7 and Cortex-M0/M0+ fault handlers. The documents show how just a little extra code is needed in the firmware to log a full core dump. Complete user-friendly formatting (printing) of logged data is on the host side.

The **STM32H743.CubeMX** folder contains the contents of the project as generated by the STM32CubeMX code generator. This content was used as the basis for the **STM32H743** and **Simple_STM32H743** projects. Using a tool such as Winmerge, programmers can check what has been added or changed based on the base version of the project.

**Disclaimer:** The STMicroelectronics (STM32CubeIDE) and NXP (MCUXpresso IDE) tools and demo boards were used to develop and test the demo code because the author owned the boards and not because these companies participated in or supported the project. The ARM MDK Community Edition and the size-restricted version of the IAR EWARM toolchains were also used to test the compatibility of the RTEdbg libraries and tools with them.
